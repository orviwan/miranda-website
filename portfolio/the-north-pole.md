Start a wonderful Christmas Eve tradition with 'I Wish I Lived at the North Pole,' an exciting debut children's picture book, written and illustrated by Miranda Barlow. The story begins, "One Christmas Eve night, a little boy said, I wish I lived at the North Pole instead." What unfolds is a magical Christmas adventure where the little boy meets and makes friends with beautiful arctic animals. There's a 'find it' puzzle on one of the pages which will delight readers young and old. But no trip to the North Pole would be complete without meeting Father Christmas, who after surfing the northern lights needs a helper to deliver Christmas gifts. This rhyming story has lovely rhythm and excellent vocabulary; teaching children about some of the animals who live in the arctic as well as being an exciting, magical Christmas journey.
