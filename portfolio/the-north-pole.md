My son shares my love of Christmas. Many years ago on Christmas Eve he said that
he wished he lived at the North Pole; the poem and eventually the illustrated
book grew from that one line. It gives me great happiness to know that many
people will be reading this book with their children on Christmas Eve as part of
their family tradition alongside putting out letters, mince pies and a glass of
something nice for Santa (and carrots for the reindeer too, of course).
