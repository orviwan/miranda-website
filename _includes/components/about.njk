              <p class="p-heading">Writing is my passion - if I don't write, I
              generally don't really know who I am or where 'here' is - it's an
              intrinsic part of me. </p>
              <p class="separator">As I began to write more, I discovered the
              link between my words and the images I have in my head. Sometimes
              a mental picture comes first, and I have to draw what I can 'see'
              before the words will come. Using this link, I built a strong
              portfolio of sketches that accompanied all my written pieces and
              realised that I was naturally illustrating my work. The children's
              books, which I write and illustrate myself have been the outcome
              of this word/image 'marriage'.</p>
              <p class="separator">My family all have a strong love of
              nature and the environment. For me, it feels fundamental for
              people to live in, and be surrounded by nature's beauty. My art is
              an exploration into bringing seasonality and wildlife into my own
              home and my family's lives. To this end, our house has become an
              extended artistic project/installation. I found that when I shared
              my work with others, they would often want to buy pieces, so I
              have begun to build my portfolio of paintings to capture and share
              what I find enchanting. My non-fiction work is part of expressing
              the whole of who I am. Often centring around my outrage and
              frustration that the female voice and female creativity is still
              dismissed and derided (craft not being valued as much as art, for
              example).</p>
              <p class="separator">All of my work is about a female voice being heard,
              being seen, and female experience being shared in the world.</p>
